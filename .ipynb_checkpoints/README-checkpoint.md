# COVID-19
In this project I process and visualize the data on the current COVID-19 pandemic. I mainly only focus on the total case numbers, as well on the count of recovered people and death tolls.

All data are sourced from the data repository of the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University at https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19.
